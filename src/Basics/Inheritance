A subclass inherits all the public and protected members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass.
Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.

Subclass object can be used in place of superclass references

Multiple Inheritance of State: Sub class inheriting multiple classes, if multiple methods will try to modify a filed with same name in multiple parent classes, which method should take precedence
Multiple Inheritance of implementation: Same name method from multiple super classes, in such cases compiler is not able to figure out which method to call
Java provide rule to do away with this problem with default methods

Multiple inheritance of type: Implement multiple Interfaces
